                <h2>Where did E come from?</h2>
                <p class="article">The letter E, as amazing and powerful as it is, has not always existed as we know it. It may be difficult to imagine a world without E. Itâ€™s such a huge part of our society today.But there was once a time before the amazing letter known as E inhabited our literature.</p>
                <p class="article">It is difficult to pinpoint exactly when and where E came from, but the earliest depiction of E is believed to be a Semitic consonant used to represent an H sound.</p>
                <p class="article">The Greeks adopted this letter and turned it into the Greek letter epsilon, which is where the latin E that is used in modern English came from.</p>
                <p class="article">The pronunciation of modern E has changed over the past centuries. It used to be pronounced like the long a sound in words such as hate or blade, but during the Great Vowel Shift between 1400 and 1700, the pronunciation shifted to match the modern long e sound. Scholars are unsure of why this shift took place.</p>
